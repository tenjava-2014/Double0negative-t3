Usage
-----

1. Put plugin in plugins folder
2. Start server
3. Due to time constraints there are Three random events, two random world events, and 1 random player event. The two world events are the asteriod event, which randomly spawns asteriods near players. Upon hitting the group they will randomly spawn diamond ore! The second world event is the blackhole event which will randomly spawn and go around destorying everything for a short time. The last event is a Random mob death match event. Randomly, when attacking a mob, you have a chance of going into a death match with mobs. If you win you get a prize! The random bounds can be set in the settings.json to make the occurance more or less frequent. Have fun!
